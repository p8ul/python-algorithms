### Depth First Search (DFS)

- Depth first search is a traversal algorithm
- Expores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- Doesn't need pointers so memory friendly
- Time complexity of traversing a graph with DFS is O(V+E)
- Application: topological ordering of Kosaraju algorithm or detecting cycles (DAG)
