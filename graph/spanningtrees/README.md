### Spanning tree
- A spanning tree of an undirected G graph is a subgraph that inclues all the vertices of G
- A tree may have several spanning trees
- We can assign a weight to each edge
- A minimun spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every spanning tree
- Applications: 
1) In big data analysis
2) Clustering algorithms
3) Finding minimum cost for a telecommunications company laying cable to a new neighborhood
- Standard algorithms: Prim's-Jarnik, Kruskal -> greedy algorithms
