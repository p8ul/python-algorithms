###  Bubble sort
- Algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort
- worst case and average complexity both O(N*N)
- used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their x coordinate at a speific scan line (a line parallel to x axis) and with incrementing y their order changes ( two elements are swapped only at intersections of two lines)
